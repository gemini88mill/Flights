Flights

This program was created by Raphael Miller using Intellij Idea. All terms of service with google API's apply

https://developers.google.com/terms/ <-- for more information. 

This program is designed to implement Google's QPX API for flight times and information. User inputs a value
for departure and arrival. QPX handles the request and returns the information for pricing and flight times 
for the given date. 

Fist push: core program functional allowing the user to get requests back using hard coding for flight 
information. (05.17.2015). 

next push - more options for user, allowing use of specific information for flight times. perhaps
implementing whatever Java's version of ncurses are. Please contact me for any questions.
