Flights

This program was created by Raphael Miller using Intellij Idea. All terms of service with google API's apply

https://developers.google.com/terms/ <-- for more information. 

This program is designed to implement Google's QPX API for flight times and information. User inputs a value
for departure and arrival. QPX handles the request and returns the information for pricing and flight times 
for the given date. 

Fist push: core program functional allowing the user to get requests back using hard coding for flight 
information. (05.17.2015). 

next push - more options for user, allowing use of specific information for flight times. perhaps
implementing whatever Java's version of ncurses are. Please contact me for any questions.

Completed basic functionality of the program. Now for the hard stuff. My goals for this project is to 
utlize different features of Java and to see what I can do with it. So next steps will include adding
a little more comments for people who happen to come across my programs. Additionally, I would like to
add save and compare functionality. In order to do that I will have to implement more of a back-end 
to the program. This will be the next steps. 

Therefore I am going to add some SQL functionality to my program. Since I would like to make an actual
functioning program. I will have to implement some kind of way to have the back end class to create a 
SQL database schema and establish a connection. perhaps have some kind of back up that allows to choose 
either a csv, txt or SQL database (which ever is more effective).

fleshed out the functionality a little bit better, offers a better representation of data for the user. 
Additionalty, allows the user to view more things and in a better format using more data Lists from 
QPX express, due to debugging, im already hitting my limit for QPX requests which is strating to become
a problem. If i want to make this an actual program, it seems that I would need to send two different 
requests. One for collection of data, and another to collect the information related to IATA codes for 
search requests. (QPX accepts request from IATA codes not from city names which most people would use 
instead). 

Im going to attempt to use laterna use make a more UI interface that retro feel. As if this program was
written in the 80's for employees that worked for an airline.

Functionality with Lanterna almost complete, although I am not an expert with lanterna it has alot of 
really interesting features that I would like to play around with. The main problem with lanterna is 
the fact that the API is currently going through a major overhaul, most of the functions will be 
deprecated by the time Lanterna 3 comes onto the scene. Lanterna 3 was announced in Feb 2014 and 
not very much has been done as far as documentation. The guys that are working on it are probably 
doing this as a hobby so it doesnt really have alot of support. 

Many issues still havent been resolved but all in all Lanterna is a pretty simple TextUI to use for
anyone wanting to create a little blast from the past program. I hope that 3 comes out soon.
