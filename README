Flights

This program was created by Raphael Miller using Intellij Idea. All terms of service with google API's apply

https://developers.google.com/terms/ <-- for more information. 

This program is designed to implement Google's QPX API for flight times and information. User inputs a value
for departure and arrival. QPX handles the request and returns the information for pricing and flight times 
for the given date. 

Fist push: core program functional allowing the user to get requests back using hard coding for flight 
information. (05.17.2015). 

next push - more options for user, allowing use of specific information for flight times. perhaps
implementing whatever Java's version of ncurses are. Please contact me for any questions.

--update--

05.17.2015
Completed basic functionality of the program. Now for the hard stuff. My goals for this project is to 
utlize different features of Java and to see what I can do with it. So next steps will include adding
a little more comments for people who happen to come across my programs. Additionally, I would like to
add save and compare functionality. In order to do that I will have to implement more of a back-end 
to the program. This will be the next steps. 

Therefore I am going to add some SQL functionality to my program. Since I would like to make an actual
functioning program. I will have to implement some kind of way to have the back end class to create a 
SQL database schema and establish a connection. perhaps have some kind of back up that allows to choose 
either a csv, txt or SQL database (which ever is more effective).
